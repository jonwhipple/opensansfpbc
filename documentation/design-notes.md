# Design Notes

## 2018-06-25

Over last two days I have noticed a few improvements we can make to all weights in r2.

Gsmallhook uni029B looks goofy in Regular. Double check all weights

eshsquatreversed uni0285 maybe should go to full descender depth?

Componentize hooks
  - use top hook of longs for all tops
  - use hook of j for all bottoms

Some questions to answer
  - Should bottom hooks go to full decender depth?
  - Should top hooks go to ascender height?
