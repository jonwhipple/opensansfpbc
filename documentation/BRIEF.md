# Open Sans – First Peoples of British Columbia
## Design brief
This is an _extension_ to Open Sans. Use extant glyphs and component parts to create the required additions.

If new glyphs must be constructed, be sure to adhere to the overall flavour of the typeface.

### Open Sans Flavour
#### Construction
Construction is based on a drawn letter, and shows little to no sign of a calligraphic hand. Italics change the form of some glyps such as /a/ and /f/.
#### X-height:Cap-height Proportion
Open Sans is characterized by a large x-height in relation to the cap-height. This is clear in comparing /H/ and /h/.
#### Ascender Height
Ascender height is slightly longer than Cap-height. Distinct, but not radically long.
#### Descender Depth
Descender depth is about 33% of x-height.
#### Width
Width of glyphs is fairly regular and doesn't vary radically.
#### Weight
There are 5 weights: light, regular, semi-bold, bold, extra-bold. Because of the extremely modest stroke modulation, each weight appears very even to itself and each weight is distinct from another.
#### Slant
The romans have no slant. The italic has a slant of about 7º–12º. The angles of bowls from stems or vertical is about 124º.
#### Contrast
The strokes are only slightly modulated. Vertical stems have almost none.
#### Angle of Contrast
The angle of contrast is vertical. This can be seen best in /O/ and /o/ and glyphs with bowls.
#### Weight Distribution
Weight is distributed evenly in each glyph and is not concentrated on the vertical or horizontal.
#### Stems
Stems are vertical and do not curve, and curves are dominanly symmetrical.
#### Joins
Joins are relatively open. Curves meeting verticals tend to have significant (but not garish) inktraps. Curves appear to pull downward when intersecting as opposed to being mostly perpendicular.
#### Bowls
Bowls tend to be rounded square shapes and maintain the vertical contrast and modest modulation of the strokes.
#### Terminals
Terminals are flat and occur and various angles.
#### Speed
The speed in the italics is not too fast or agressive. Some letterforms change in the italic such as /a/ (from double storey to single), /e/ which loses its horizontal in favour of an egg shape, and /f/ which acquires a descender.
#### Regularity
The forms and parts of the glyphs are very regular throughout.
#### Flourish
Open Sans does not have flourishes.
#### Decoration
Open Sans doesn't use any decoration in the glyph strokes or counters
#### Dimension
Open Sans is flat and is not a shaded or dimesnional typeface.
